# Unit 1

## What This Does

This is a retrieval-augmented question that provide a response from a pre-built system campus_life corpus: 88 shorts, student writing posts to learn more about certain rules within the campus such as parking permit, graduation requirements, housing lottery and how campus jobs are related to financial aid. When a question is asked for example "how work-study and non-work-study affect financial aid?" or "is the housing lottery random?" the system dig into all resources it contains and provide the answer. In the case if no resource contains information about what has been asked the system reply: "I don't have enough information about that".

## Chunking Strategy

All posts from the campus life are shorts, 317 characters average with (shortest 178, longest 549). Each post contains 2 to 5 paragraphs.

**Chunk size:**
**Overlap:**

## Sample Chunks

**Chunk 1** — source: `source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0` — produced by: `produced by: chunker.py::fallback_split`

```
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: ` source: course_biol_160.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::fallback_split`

```
BIOL 160 Cell Biology

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is lecture three times a week with a weekly lab. Assessment: four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

Expect 9 to 11 hours a week, the heaviest first-year course by reputation.

The one piece of advice: the unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `course_hist_118_workload.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::fallback_split`

```
Workload for HIST 118 Modern World History

People keep asking so: a lot of reading, about 120 pages a week, but no problem sets. That's real time, not optimistic time.

It's front-loaded — the first month is heavier than the rest, partly because you're learning the format.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::fallback_split`

```
Re: Pellew Dining Hall

Adding to what people have said about Pellew Dining Hall. The wait figure of 12 to 18 minutes at peak matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely.

Also worth saying: the furthest hall from anywhere, next to the athletics centre. Nobody tells you this at orientation.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: ` housing_innisfree_hall.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::fallback_split`

```
Innisfree Hall — what it's actually like

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Built 1991, renovated 2022. Rooms are doubles arranged as pairs sharing one bathroom between two rooms.

The good: the shared-bathroom-between-two-rooms arrangement is the best compromise on campus.

The bad: no air conditioning, which matters for the first three weeks of September.

Laundry costs $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. On noise: moderate; the building is L-shaped and the short wing is much quieter.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
"how work-study and non-work-study affect financial aid?"
**Answer:**

```
Work-study earnings do not count against your financial aid the way ordinary income does, whereas non-work-study campus jobs do count against it.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

## Run Log — Before

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 | 5/5   | 5/5   | 5/5   | MET     |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

### Criterion 1: "Does studying abroad include in financial aid" — run 1

- Best distance: 0.3667 (passed the gate)
- Sources retrieved: admin_campus_jobs_and_financial_aid.txt, admin_declaring_a_major.txt, admin_graduation_requirements.txt, admin_pass_fail_option.txt, admin_study_abroad.txt

Yes, your financial aid package travels with you when you study abroad.
Source: `admin_study_abroad.txt`

### Criterion 2: "how work-study and non-work-study affect financial aid"— run 1

- Best distance: 0.3008 (passed the gate)
- Sources retrieved: admin_campus_jobs_and_financial_aid.txt, admin_study_abroad.txt, course_econ_101_workload.txt, course_engl_205_exams.txt, money_jobs.txt

Work-study earnings do not count against your financial aid the way ordinary income does, whereas non-work-study campus jobs do count against it.

Source: `admin_campus_jobs_and_financial_aid.txt`

### Criterion 3:

Produced by `run_eval.py::check_out_of_scope`, cutoff 0.6. Refused 5 of 5.

Retrieval is deterministic and the gate is a comparison against a
fixed number, so these do not vary between runs — one pass over the
list is the whole measurement.

| Out-of-scope question                                       | Best distance | Gate    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| What is the capital of Mongolia?                            | 0.825         | refused |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine?                 | 0.934         | refused |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup?                                 | 0.886         | refused |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | 0.844         | refused |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust?                          | 0.896         | refused |

### Criterion 4: "Does the campus offer a quite environment for study" — run 1

Best distance: 0.5218 (passed the gate)

- Sources retrieved: course_econ_101.txt, housing_aldridge_hall.txt, housing_tamsin_court.txt, money_jobs.txt, transit_walking.txt

Yes, Aldridge Hall has quiet floors on levels 3 and 4 that are genuinely enforced (housing_aldridge_hall.txt). Additionally, Tamsin Court is quiet structurally because it has concrete floors between units.
Source: `housing_tamsin_court.txt`.

### Criterion 5: "Which month does the campus offer sale for parking?" — run 1

- Best distance: 0.4374 (passed the gate)
- Sources retrieved: admin_parking_permits.txt, housing_aldridge_hall.txt, money_textbooks.txt, transit_shuttle.txt, transit_walking.txt

Student permits for the west lots go on sale in August.
Source: `admin_parking_permits.txt`.

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| #   | Criterion                          | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Retrieved chunk contain the answer |         |               |
| 2   | Every answer name a source         |         |               |
| 3   | Gate stops-out-of-corpus question  |         |               |
| 4   |                                    |         |               |
| 5   |                                    |         |               |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?
